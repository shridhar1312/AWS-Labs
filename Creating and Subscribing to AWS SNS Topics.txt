Creating and Subscribing to AWS SNS Topics
Introduction
In this live AWS environment, you will be using the AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS). You will create an SNS topic and then subscribe to that topic using multiple endpoints (SMS, email, and AWS Lambda). This environment allows you to demonstrate successful interaction with the SNS service by creating SNS topics and adding subscribers to those topics. At the end of this activity, you will have demonstrated you have a basic understanding of the SNS service, the components within it, and how to use the service in the AWS console.

Solution
Log in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials provided on the lab instructions page. Please ensure you are using the us-east-1 (N. Virginia region) region.

This lesson's GitHub repo.

NOTE: When creating the lambda subscription, you will have to close the permission errors that appear. Afterward, you will be able to continue and finish the lab.

Additionally, please delete your email in the SNS section before closing the lab.
